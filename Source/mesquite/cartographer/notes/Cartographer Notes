Kip:  Is there a way to turn off selected "taxa" so that they do not show up on the map when using Cartographer? 
For example I have several species that all use the same base map, but some distributions partially overlap 
in ways that would make it best to show only a subset on any one map. Is there a way to not show the symbols at all 
for some? I could make a separate file for each complimentary set, but would rather not maintain multiple files 
and then try and recall which taxa are in which file.

	from Wayne (May 2008):
	

I think the confusion I might have had last time is that I wasn't using mercator, 
and thus I needed to enter parameters, and didn't realize it.  I entered 
points but nothing seemed to happen.  I know that the text under Uncalibrated 
Projection comments on that, but I wonder if either the projection parameters 
dialog should show up in the opening sequence of the taxa map, or if the 
calibration blue warning might change once 3 points are entered.

=================

Is there a way for a set of calibration points to be remembered across changes of projection?  
I set the calibration points, being unsure of the projection, then changed the projection, and all the points vanished.

Oh wait, when I touch on the point again, it asks if I want to remove it, even though it doesn't show.  So it's there but invisible?

OK, maybe I didn't enter the parameters correctly. I wiped out all calibration points, made sure parameters were set, 
then added points, and it seems to work.

But now I tried to get a new map going, and things were going smoothly, except that after adding two calibration points 
the calibration point tool won't add any more.  I touch on the map, and nothing happens; no dialog box shows; no warning, 
nothing special in the log.  Attached is file in that state.  Try to add more calibration points.



OK, so the bug where I can't add more calibration points to the map arises because after adding the first two, 
it instantly tries to plot the tree (I'm using Orthographic) and the x, y pixels of some nodes are so big (>60,000) 
that the pythagorean calculations for whether a point is in a spot overflow a 32 bit integer.

I can short circuit the bug in particular but there may be other issues with pixel values so big.

Still some problems with optimization, where it cycles through scores that go up and down and up and down with no end.

post 1.0:
	spot size confusion/standard taxon spots
	zoom away so see small version of map
	- remove taxon tool?
	- collect maps, make calibration files, notes	

Cartographer 2.0
	- add Bipolar Oblique Conic Conformal
	- General perspective
	- legend for symbols
	
	- change locationreconstructor so that it uses long lats
	- read in locality as annotation
	- grid start and end points
	- hide dots on otherside of world
	- symbols and color from associated taxon block
	- better grid lines
	
	- have way for taxon names to not overlap
